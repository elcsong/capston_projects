# Tiktok Project
<hr>
<B>Scenario Overview</B>: <p>In this scenario, I am part of TikTok's data science team, which is embarking on a new project to develop a machin learning model. **This model aims to: ** classify statements made in videos as either claims or opinions. A "claim" is defined as information lacking a source or derived from an unverified source, while an "opinion" represents personal beliefs or thoughts.</p>
<p>
My immediate task, as outlined in emails from Rosie Mae Bradshow and Orion Rainier(Data Scientist), is to assit with the preparation of this data for analysis. Despite my recent joining, my previous experience with Python, particularly through the Google certificate program, is considered valuable for this phase.

Orion Rainer has already initiated a Jupyter notebook containing the relevant dataset but is currently tied up with another project's final stages. My assistance is sought to carry forward this work, which includes coding and preparing the notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) that will follow later.</p>
<hr>
<b>Specifically, I'am asked to</b>:
<ul>* Import the attached data into the notebook.</ul>
<ul>* Review the dataset to summarize column data types, count non-null data values, and distinguish between relevant and irrelevant columns.</ul>
<ul>* Identify and focus on a couple of variables, noting their minimum and maximum values.</ul>
<ul>* Consider creating meaningful variables by either combining existing data structures or modifying them as needed.</ul>

This preparatory work is crucial for laying the groundwork for the subsequent development of the machine learning model. It involves organizing the data, which is key to ensuring that the model built later on is robust and effective in classifying viedio content accurately.
