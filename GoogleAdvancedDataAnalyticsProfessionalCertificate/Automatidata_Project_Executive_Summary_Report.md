# New York City TLC Project Preliminary Data Summary

#### Executive summary report

## Overview
The NYC Taxi & Limousine Commision has contracted with Automatidata to build a regression model that predicts taxi cab fares. In this part of the project, the Automatidata data team performed a preliminary inspection of the data supplied by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission in order to inform the team of key data variable descriptions, and ensure the information provided is suitable for generating clear and meaningful insights.

## Project Status
* Explored dataset to find any unusual values.
* Considered which variables are most useful to build predictive models
* Considered potential interactions between the two chosen variables
* Examined which omponents of the provided data will provide relevant insights
* Built the groundwork for future exploartory data analysis, visulalizations and models.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a complete exploratory data analysis
2. Perform any data cleaning and data analysis steps to understand unusual variables
3. Use descriptive statistics to learn more about the data
4. Create and run a regression model

## Key Insights
* This dataset includes variables that should be helpful for building prediction model on taxi cab ride fares.
* The identified unusual values are trips that are short distance but have high charges associated with them, as shown in the total_amount variable.
